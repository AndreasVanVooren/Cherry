# Cherry
A lightweight chat-based song request system for Beat Saber.

## Please Note
I did not make this mod as a replacement for other song request mods. I made this mainly for myself and a few other people who wanted a request mod that's more lightweight and streamlined.

Please **do not** request any features to this mod with "Can you add 'X feature' like how it is in 'Y request mod'?" I won't be taking new feature requests publicly.

## Why?
Like said above, I wanted to make a song request manager that was more lightweight and with room for expandability.

## Capabilities
- Allows twitch chat to request songs using the !bsr <key> command.
- Filter By: Map Rating
- Filter By: Automapped Songs
- Filter By: Minimum Map Age
- Filter By: Map Song Length
- Filter By: Min/Max NJS
- Allow a maximum # of requests from specific user roles (Normal, Subscriber, VIP, Mod)
- Option to prefix all messages with ! for TTS bots
- !oops command

**PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A KEY ONLY REQUEST MANAGER**

This means, people have to enter !bsr (key). This mod does not search by song name!
